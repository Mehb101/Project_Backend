This is the backend API for my Pro-Tasker application. It is built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. The backend handles user registration and login using JWT authentication, and it provides secure CRUD operations for projects and tasks. Each user can create their own projects, and each project can have multiple tasks. All routes that deal with projects and tasks are protected, meaning the user must be logged in and must only access their own data. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database to protect user information. I used MongoDB Atlas as my database, and the backend is deployed on Render as a Web Service. The main routes include user authentication (/api/users), project management (/api/projects), and task management (/api/projects/:projectId/tasks). The backend also includes basic CORS support so that the frontend can communicate with the API. Environment variables such as MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET are required and are stored securely through Render. This backend powers the entire Pro-Tasker application by handling the data, verifying user permissions, and sending JSON responses to the frontend.
